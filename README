MarkBot

This will be the CAD/CAM files and software for building a telepresense
remote rebot.

This is for a telecommuter to have a physical presence at a remote office.

Should include:
quiet mobile platform for carpet and hard flooring
navigation omni-camera
2-way video conferencing with multiple microphones
multiple wifi connections for overlapping hand off, possibly backup low-rate
link
a way to drive locally for dealing with a failure
ability to dock/undock for charging without local help
ability to open (heavy) doors
battery power for a few hours minimum of teleconference plus 15 minutes of
movement




Major components:
Chassis
-Heavy enough to push doors open
-easy to open for maintnance
-soundproofed
-low CG, but tall enough for a comfortable converation
-low chance of collision/spin injury to other people -- round, no protrusions, covered wheels 

Batteries
-low fire hazard (no lipo?)

Motor / drivetrain with encoders
-3-4mph top speed
-power to open doors
-quiet

Mecanum wheels / suspension
-some suspension so you don't get lift-off of Mecanum wheel going over bumps/thresholds

motor servoing controllers

Core cpu (sheevaplug/dockstar/raspberry pi)
-enough capacity to process cameras, mics for transmition
-ideally enough CPU to process mics for source separation on-board
-ideally enough CPU to have some visual self-driving ability to help overcome control lag

wifi links
-multiple links for smooth hand-off

microphone array (6ish MEMS mics -> PIC32 -> usb)

omnidirectional camera

front camera

speakers

display
-7ish inches.  (Nook color since I have one?)

chassis sensors
-internal mic
-accelerometer (vibration and jarring)
-temperature

charger/dock
-self docking
-low voltage
-smart connection monitoring (current imbalance or high voltage drop across connector)

local controller
-wiimote nunchuck?

remote controller
-web, hardware, or software?  all three?
